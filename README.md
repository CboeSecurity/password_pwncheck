# password_pwncheck
Enterprise Password Quality Checking using any hash data sources (HaveIBeenPwned lists, et al)

The purpose of this project is to help companies maintain a stronger password policy without having to jump through too many hoops.  Currently, we support NIST 800-63B features such as testing the password against a long minimum length (default of 15), not matching prev
ious passwords (or similar entries), and most important- the password can't belong to a breach list.

The project consists of two parts:

* A password server -  This is currently a fairly simple and easy to extend python script that contains all the logic for testing passwords.
* A password plugin client - There is work in the pipe for a Windows Password Filter DLL, a Kerberos module, and a PAM module.  This should satisfy most modern enterprise extensible password management solutions.  If you find this doesn't support you, than feel free to code and request a pull into the main project.

# Installation

> This code is very fresh- it is functional and has been tested to work, but the installation and configuration will require some level of knowledge of configuring variable values in scripts and know-how on how Kerberos/PAM/AD perform password change management.  This is mainly because I make no claims that I am a technical writer, so I may be covering configuration in broad strokes...

(Under Construction)

## Password Server
* The password server needs to have downloaded password hash lists provided to it.  These should sit in the `./db` folder.  A great place to start for your breached passwords is [https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords], Thanks to Troy Hunt for all his efforts (he is in large part the inspiration behind this project).
* Also, make sure you have a valid key/certificate chain.  These two files should have their paths matched with the `SSLCertFile` and `SSLKeyFile` variables.
* The code was originally written in python 2.7, though now should work in python 3 and __might__ work in python 2.7.  You should be able to run it via `python-2.7 ./pwned-password-server.py`

## AD Password filter DLL
* From a Dev Studio command line, run `resbuilder.bat` from its directory in the ad-password-pwncheck project
* Build the solution, specifically the `ad_password_pwncheck` project.
* Copy the resulting ad_password_pwncheck.dll into the `%windir%\system32` folder on all domain controllers in the domain.
* Run `wevtutil im Resources.man /rf:"%windir%\system32\ad_password_pwncheck.dll" /mf:"%windir%\system32\ad_password_pwncheck.dll"` to properly register windows event logs
* Run the included registry file to enable registry settings

## Kerberos filter Shared Object

* Run the `./build.sh` too, make sure openssl-devel and curl-devel modules are loaded in your SLES/RedHat/Debian derived distribution.
* Copy the `/lib/security/krb_password_pwncheck.so` library to the kerberos plugins/pwqual folder.
* Configure the krb5.conf to have the correct path:
```
[plugins]
    pwqual = {
      module = pwncheck:pwqual/pwncheck.so 
    }
```

## PAM Password filter Shared Object

* Run the `./build.sh` too, make sure openssl-devel and curl-devel modules are loaded in your SLES/Redhat/Debian derived distribution.
* Copy the `/lib/security/pwncheck.so` library to the PAM folder (typically /lib/security)  if it isn't there already.
* Configure /etc/pam.d/ files that use "password" module to load the pam_pwncheck.so module first, in a way similar to:
```
password	requisite			pam_pwncheck.so url=https://<password server domain>/checkpwd?u=%s&p=%s
password	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so obscure sha512 use_authtok
```
(note the pam_unix setting here is a pre-existing entry)
